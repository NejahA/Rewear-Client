 The changes I made to your code are as follows:

1. I added a new file named `Rewards.jsx` that contains the rewards and badges data for users. This file includes a mockup of user points, level, streak, referrals, and a list of recent activity. Here's the content of the `Rewards.jsx` file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const RewardsData = {
  points: 100,
  level: 5,
  streak: 30,
  referrals: 2,
  recentActivity: [
    { action: "Checked In", points: 5, createdAt: new Date() },
    { action: "Posted a Photo", points: 10, createdAt: new Date() },
    { action: "Shared an Event", points: 15, createdAt: new Date() },
  ],
};

export default RewardsData;
```

2. In `AuthContext.jsx`, I imported the `RewardsData` from the newly created `Rewards.jsx` file and added a state variable named `rewards` to store the rewards data for each authenticated user:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import RewardsData from './Rewards.jsx';

const AuthContext = React.createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // ... existing code ...

  const [rewards, setRewards] = useState(null);

  // ... existing code ...

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isAuthenticated, signIn, signOut, rewards }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => React.useContext(AuthContext);
```

3. In `UserProfile.jsx`, I added a new state variable named `rewards` to store the user's rewards data, and a function named `fetchRewards` to fetch the rewards data from the AuthProvider's `rewards` state:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContex.jsx';
import RewardsData from '../Rewards.jsx';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const auth = useAuth();
  const [rewards, setRewards] = useState(null);

  // ... existing code ...

  const fetchRewards = async () => {
    if (auth.isAuthenticated) {
      setRewards(auth.rewards || RewardsData);
    }
  };

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchRewards();
  }, [auth.user]); // Fetch rewards when the user changes

  // ... existing code ...
};

export default UserProfile;
```

4. In `UserProfile.jsx`, I added a new section to display the user's rewards data:

```javascript
// ... existing code ...

{/* 🔥 NEW: Rewards Section */}
<div className="mb-5">
  <h3 className="text-center mb-4">Rewards & Badges</h3>

  {/* Points & Level */}
  <div className="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3">
    // ... existing code ...
  </div>

  // ... existing badge and recent activity code ...
</div>

// ... existing code ...
```
